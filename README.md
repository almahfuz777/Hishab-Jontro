This is a simple calculator application created using _**JavaFX**_ and **_SceneBuilder_** for my learning purposes.
The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
## Features
-  **Basic arithmetic operations**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division
- **User-friendly** interface built with JavaFX and SceneBuilder
## Known Issues
  - There might be some minor bugs in the application that I will fix later.
## Contributing
- If you would like to contribute to this project or report any bugs, feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue on the repository.
## Note
The project was created as a part of my personal learning journey in Java. The code is not optimized for large or complex calculations. Despite some minor bugs, the program is a functional tool for basic mathematical calculations.
